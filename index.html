                    Key Points:<br/>
                    <li> Aim is to simulate and optimize the behaviour of an experimental setup, consisting of a piezoceramic with a base plate, 
                    in a FEM simulation. Modelling the sensor design into <strong>COMSOL Multiphysics</strong> and then to systematically test the properties of different 
                    adaptations and design variants and simulate a transfer function.</li> 
                    <li> To enhance and support my data interests I learned and used <strong>Pandas Library</strong> along with <strong>matplotlib</strong> and <strong>seaborn</strong> for data wrangling 
                        ,plotting and comparing the simulated data with the experimental data and to optimize some values in the simulation for better results.</li>

                <p> I have multiple electronic PCB design projects using an industry level design software Altium Designer. In my previous company we designed and developed a headlamp of an electric bike 
                    which turned on automatically when in dark places. We also designed and developed a PCB for research, to efficiently route the cables inside a battery pack of an Electric vehicle.
                    I also assisted in component selection and creation of BOM of the developed PCB considering all the necessary factors like the specifications of the component, effective cost due to it etc. 
                    <br>Key Points:<br/>
                    <li>Acquired knowledge of <strong>Altium Designer</strong> software.</li>
                    <li>Gained experience in how the hardware in electronics is designed and developed.</li>
                    <li>I also assembled and soldered some of our PCBs after they were printed. Assembly was critical as majorly there were SMD components on the board.</li>

                <p>In my all four years of Electrical Engineering, I was a part of a Robotics team that participated in National level competitions and developed Robots
                    both Autonomous and Manual Control from scratch. From developing and manufacturing the mechanical design to integrating and programming the hardware electronics.
                    I am putting this here in the project section as I actually learned a lot and gained very important practical experiences which helped me to get a job immediately 
                    after my Bachelor's in an Electric Vehicle manufacturing company.
                    <br>Key Points:<br/>
                    <li>Integrating different <strong>actuators and sensors</strong> in the Robots for precise locomotion and task completion.</li>
                    <li>Microcontroller Programming in <strong>embedded C</strong></li>
                    <li>Team Lead in my final year managing a team of 30. Gained important <strong>leadership and team management</strong> skills  </li>

                <p>
                    I also have a published research paper in the field of Robotics with the Title 'PID for a Multi-wheeled Robot using a Six Axis Gyroscope as the Feedback Sensor'.
                    Although a bit naive writing, the paper holds a good concept overall. Here is the link for the same : <a href="Published Paper.pdf" target="_blank">Open PDF</a>
